## change log

### HEAD
- Updated to Steamworks SDK v1.49.
- Added SteamInventory interface.
- Added `SteamUserCallback.onAuthSessionTicket()`. (#83)

### [1.8.0]
- MacOS: removed 32-bit support.
- MacOS: raised minimum version support to OS X 10.9.
- API change: split up initialization into `SteamAPI.loadLibraries()` and `SteamAPI.init()`. Allows to call some native functions, like restartAppIfNecessary(), before SteamAPI.init().
- API change: applied same change as above to `SteamGameServerAPI.loadLibraries()` and `SteamGameServerAPI.init()`.
- SteamGameServerAPI skips loading of shared libraries if already loaded by SteamAPI. (#56)
- Added `SteamUGC.deleteItem()`. (#64)
- Added Voice API. [contributed by sf17k]
- Fixed signature of `SteamMatchmaking.getLobbyMemberLimit()`. (#67)
- Added `SteamFriends.getFriendGamePlayed()`. (#68)
- Added `SteamMatchmaking.[set|get]LobbyMemberData()`. (#72) [contributed by XaeroDegreaz]
- Added `SteamUserStats.downloadLeaderboardEntriesForUsers()` (#74)

### [1.7.0]
- Updated to Steamworks SDK v1.42.
- Reviewed all API functions which use NIO buffers. They now all use direct *byte* buffers and properly read `ByteBuffer#position()` as offset and `ByteBuffer#remaining()` as size/capacity markers. Also, they never change the buffer state, so for functions returning data, the caller must ensure that buffer position and/or limit are updated accordingly.
- Removed redistributable shared libraries from source control. They are now pulled from the `./sdk/redistributable_bin/` folder directly by Maven.
- Added `steamworks4j-server` module. It creates two native libraries, steamworks4j-server and steamworks4j-encryptedappticket.
- Added `tests` module, which now contains all test apps.
- Added SteamRemoteStorage callbacks to notify application about external changes to workshop item subscriptions. (#42)
- Added SteamRemoteStorage functions for asynchronous file access and file/cloud queries.
- Added SteamNetworking.getP2PSessionState(). (#43)
- Added SteamUser functions to request encrypted app ticket. (#45)
- Added SteamEncryptedAppTicket server functions. (#45)
- API change: adjusted SteamGameServer.sendUserConnectAndAuthenticate() to better mimic the C++ API.
- Added SteamMatchmakingServers wrapper.
- Refactored shared library loader to work with the new `server` and `test` modules.
- Added some options to customize the shared library loader behavior during development.
- Moved all SteamGameServer* classes to the server module.
- API change: Removed `API` parameter when creating HTTP and networking wrappers. Added SteamGameServerHTTP and SteamGameServerNetworking to create server-side versions.
- Added SteamFriendsCallback.onGameServerChangeRequested(). (#48)
- Removed support for Linux 32-bit.
- Updated native Windows build to a newer version of premake 5 (alpha 11).
- Added some missing SteamApps functions. (#50)

- Added remaining functions to activate Steam overlay.
- Added functions for rich presence and game invites to SteamFriends (#38).
- API change: the SteamFriendsCallback interface has been extended to reflect the latest additions.
- API change: removed SteamID.getNativeHandle(). All native handles can now be queried with SteamNativeHandle.getNativeHandle().

- API change: all uses of appID in member functions and callbacks now use 32-bit ints.

### [1.4.0]
- Removed steamworks4j-natives subproject. Native libraries are now added as resources to steamworks4j.jar directly.
- Added functions to query global stats. This also adds a new method to SteamUserStatsCallback (#36).
- Updated shared library loader, adding a few fallbacks in case executables cannot be written to, or launched from, java.io.tmpdir.
- API change: SteamAPI.init() now throws SteamException if loading of native libraries fails. The function now returns false only if initialization fails for Steamworks reasons (e.g. no Steam client running).

- Removed static native callback objects. They are now created and stored per instance of each interface.
- Added functions to check for SteamAPICall status and result.
- Added option to specify path to jar or directory from where to load native libraries. Mostly meant to avoid need of 'mvn package' after recompiling native code during development.
- API change: Removed static dispose() methods. User applications need to call SteamInterface.dispose() to prevent native memory leaks.
- API change: SteamUserStatsCallback.onUserStatsReceived() is now passed a SteamID instead of a long value.
- API change: Simplified all interface constructors by removing 'pointer' parameters. They are obtained internally now.
