- Added SteamFriends API to retrieve avatar images.
- Added SteamFriends API to enumerate friend lists and query persona states.
- Added SteamGameServer, SteamGameServerStats and SteamNetworking APIs. [initially added by Francisco "Franz" Bischoff]
- Updated test application to prepare for more (isolated) tests. SteamAPITestApplication is now called SteamClientAPITestApp.
- Added SteamNetworkingTestApp for testing P2P networking functions.
- Removed static native callback objects. They are now created and stored per instance of each interface.
- Added functions to check for SteamAPICall status and result.
- Added option to specify path to jar or directory from where to load native libraries. Mostly meant to avoid need of 'mvn package' after recompiling native code during development. 
- API change: Removed static dispose() methods. User applications need to call SteamInterface.dispose() to prevent native memory leaks.
- API change: SteamUserStatsCallback.onUserStatsReceived() is now passed a SteamID instead of a long value.
- API change: Simplified all interface constructors by removing 'pointer' parameters. They are obtained internally now.
